## Building

### With GNOME Builder and flatpak

Pre-requisite: install the `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable` SDK extension with flatpak. Builder might do this for you automatically, but it will install an older version; make sure  the version installed matches the version of the Freedesktop SDK GNOME uses (at the time of writing: 20.08).

Open the project in GNOME Builder and make the `dev.alextren.Spot.development.json` configuration active. Then build :)

### Manually

Requires Rust (stable), GTK3, and a couple other things. Also requires libhandy1: it is not packaged on all distros at the moment, you might have to build it yourself.

**Build** dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04 for instance: ```build-essential pkg-config meson libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev-bin libgtk-3-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev```. 

Then, with meson:

```
meson target -Dbuildtype=debug -Doffline=false --prefix="$HOME/.local"
ninja install -C target
```

This will install a `.desktop` file among other things, and the spot executable will be put in `.local/bin` (you might want to add it to your path).
